Inspired by <a href = "https://github.com/glutanimate/review-heatmap" target="_blank"> Glutanimate's Review Heatmap</a>, Extended Heatmap visualizes your daily card rating activity.

<h3> FEATURES </h3>

<ul> 
        <li> Visualize your daily activity by review type. </li>
        <li> Remind yourself of <strong> WHEN </strong> you forgot a card so you can remember <strong> WHY </strong> you forgot it </li>
        <li> See which cards you rated again/good/hard/easy by clicking on the cell. </li> 
        <li> See what days you pressed a certain rating more often. </li>
            
</ul>

<i> Just as you would for <strong> Review Heatmap </strong>, you can press each date to see the cards you rated again/good/hard/easy on that day. </i>

<h3> PURPOSE </h3>
POV: Exams are due tommorow and you have been staying on track with your daily Anki. However, you still feel anxious. What if I forget what <i> diabetes insipidus </i> is again? I <i> always </i> forget what the quotient rule is. 
<br> <br> 
Forget no more!
<br> <br>
With the rating heatmap, you can associate when you forgot a card with the context of a specific date, allowing you to remember why you forgot that card. 

<br> 
<br> 
Oh? It was after that derivatives test on <strong> Friday </strong> that I rated the quotient rule card 'again'. <i> I probably got it mixed up with the chain rule after that test. </i>

<br> 
<br> 

By having the context of when you rated each card, you can hone in on the much more important "why" you rated it that way.
