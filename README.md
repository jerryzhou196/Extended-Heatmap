Based off of <a href = "https://github.com/glutanimate/review-heatmap" target="_blank"> Glutanimate's Review Heatmap</a>, Extended Heatmap visualizes your daily card rating activity.

<h3> FEATURES </h3>

<ul> 
        <li> Visualize your daily activity by review type. </li>
        <li> See which cards you rated again/good/hard/easy by clicking on the cell. </li> 
        <li> See what days you pressed a certain rating more often. </li>
            
</ul>

<i> Just as you would for <strong> Review Heatmap </strong>, you can press each date to see the cards you rated again/good/hard/easy on that day. </i>

<h3> PURPOSE </h3>

This was created off a need to see cards I rated 'Again' on specific days. These cards are typically recurring lapses, and so it is useful to be able to be reminded of the cards you pressed "Again" by a specific day. For instance, if you have an exam tommorow, it is useful to be able to go back to that 300 card review you did on Saturday and see which cards you clicked "Again" on.
