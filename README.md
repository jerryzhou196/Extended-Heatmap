# Extended-Heatmap

Based off of <a href = "https://github.com/glutanimate/review-heatmap" > Glutanimate's Review Heatmap </a> , Extended Heatmap allows you to see a heatmap each day
 by how much you rated each card in your Anki Collection.  

This was created off a need to see cards I rated 'Again' on specific days. These cards are typically recurring lapses, and so it is useful to be able to be reminded
of the cards you pressed "Again" by a specific day.
