Based off of <a href = "https://github.com/glutanimate/review-heatmap" > Glutanimate's Review Heatmap </a>,Extended Heatmap visualizes your daily card rating activity.

<h3> FEATURES </h3>

<ul> 
        <li> Visualize your daily activity by review type. </li>
        <li> See which cards you rated again/good/hard/easy by clicking on the cell. </li> 
        <li> See what days you pressed a certain rating more often. </li>
        
        
        
</ul>


Just as you would for Review Heatmap, you can press each date to see the cards you rated again/good/hard/easy on that day. 


This was created off a need to see cards I rated 'Again' on specific days. These cards are typically recurring lapses, and so it is useful to be able to be reminded of the cards you pressed "Again" by a specific day.
